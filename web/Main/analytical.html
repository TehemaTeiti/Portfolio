                        <h4>Analysis of skills</h4>
                        <p>During this training, I made several projects which were instructives and where I could put
                          in practice what I have learned, resolve problems I was
                          confronted with and discover more about the IoT domain. Coming from a
                          computer science domain, I discover the electronical and signal processing fields. That helps
                          to understand the process of an IoT device, from
                          the design of a circuit board to the deployement of web services.
                          The following
                          criteria are used
                          to determine the level:
                          <ul>
                            <li><span class="bold">AP- level of application</span>: follow-up of instructions or
                              procedures</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">AN- level of analysis</span>: improvement or optimization of
                              solutions or proposals</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">M - level of proficiency</span>: program design or specification
                              definitions</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">EX - level of expertise</span>: definition of orientations or
                              strategies</li>
                          </ul>
                          Also, the mode field determines the main acquisition methods for an activity:
                          <ul>
                            <li><span class="bold">IT</span>: Initial Training</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">PE</span>: Peer Exchange</li>

                            <p>In this courses, I could understand concepts of a smart sensor. I was able to define
                              sensitivity of a sensor
                              and design an electronic circuit to adapt the impedance of a gas sensor. Also, I
                              programmed with Arduino to acquire sensor measurements and send commands to actuators.
                              These courses were interesting for me because I came from a computer science field and I
                              could discover the electronic part of systems.</p>
                            <p>Also, the manufacture of a nanoparticles sensor was very interesting. I could see at a
                              chemical level how a sensor can detect specific gases and understand the problems around
                              measurements depending on the environment (humidity, temperature, …).

                            <p>Having a lack of knowledge on signal processing and network, I had difficulties to
                              understand wireless communications courses. However, I had an overview on the wireless
                              networks used for connected objects and I can understand the interest for this kind of
                              networks.</p>

                            <p>Also, thanks to Emerging network course, I understand how a network can be smart with a
                              set of rules defined on the routers which can take decision depending on the arriving
                              packets.</p>

                              Thanks to service architecture courses, I am able to implements web services using SOAP
                              or Rest architectures with Java EE, knowing the advantages and the drawbacks for each
                              architecture. To do this, I can implement a Rest API to provide services and also send
                              HTTP request to access these web services. I can also orchestrate activities with BPEL.

                              devices using different technology. I can interact with OM2M application in order to
                              create, update, read and delete nodes through Rest requests.

                              Software engineering course allows me to plan a project using an Agile Method such as
                              Scrum with Icescrum tool. I understand the different type of methods to manage a project,
                              their advantages and their drawbacks.

                              rules in order to infer information with the help of a reasoner.

                              Thanks to these courses, I understand the difference between an invention and an
                              innovation. I am able to put a process in place to make an innovative product, such as
                              the design thinking process. Also, before starting a project, I am able to make a state
                              of the art about existing invention in the same field in order to situate us and to
                              analyze the needs of the project.

                              Also, social psychology and team management courses was useful because I better
                              understand conflicts that may happen in a team and how to solve them.

                              My work in this project allows me to make a state of the art about communication
                              protocols, databases and web server in IoT field.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              In term of technic, I can suggest a strategy and justify technologic choices depending on
                              the application for data communication and storage process. I am able to develop a Rest
                              API to provide services for HTTP client and to use communication protocols like MQTT as a
                              publish-subscribe based protocol to exchange data with a MQTT server like TTN.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              In term of social, I can work in a group with members coming from varied background,
                              exchange with them and find a solution as a team. I can propose idea to solve a problem
                              and justify in front of people my choices.

                        <h4>Self evaluation</h4>

                        <p>Thanks to this training, I learn a lot on the IoT domain in term of electronic, software and
                          network infrastructure.</p>

                        <p>I mainly enhance my computer science skills through Middle and Service training unit through
                          courses and projects. This concept was a discovery for me and I very appreciate developing
                          distributed applications and learn new communication protocols. Moreover, these experiences
                          reinforce me about being able to choose the right technologies and architecture to use in IoT
                          systems regarding needs and applications.</p>

                        <p>Also, I am able to understand electronic schematics, to design them and to acquire data from
                          a sensor through a microcontroller like Arduino. I understand how sensors can communicate
                          through wireless networks to an end-point application and what issues are involved in the
                          communication process.</p>

                        <p>Another point that I enjoyed during this training was group projects that we made all along,
                          especially the innovative project. We had management and social psychology courses that help
                          us to organize our work and to understand why conflicts may happen in a team and how we can
                          solve them.</p>

                        <p>However, skills are still missing at the end of this journey. I have a lack of knowledge in
                          electronic and signal processing, so it was difficult for me
                          to understand related courses in detail. Despite everything, I had an overview of these
                          fields and
                          I understand the issues involving. In this way, it will be much easier to understand if a
                          problem occurs and
                          in which way I have to go to solve it.</p>

                        <h4>Balance sheet</h4>


                        <p>Building this portfolio allowed me to take a step back about this year. On one hand, I could
                          highlight skills that I gained and see what I am able to do in the IoT domain. On the other
                          hand, I could see what skills are still missing and if I want to develop a complete IoT
                          application, I will probably need to work on them.
